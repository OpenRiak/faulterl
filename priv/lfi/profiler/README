
LIB-FI Library Profiler

Purpose: take a binary library and extract information regarding exported
functions and possible retrun values for each function.

Usage:
make
./dasmfn.sh <path to library>
./listfn.sh <path to library>

Special case: profiling linux system calls
make
./dasmfn.sh <path to debug-vmlinux-kernel>
./syscalls.sh <path to /arch/i386/kernel/syscall_table.S>

Note:
The debug kernel can be downloaded in /boot with apt-get install linux-image-debug-... (apt-cache search kernel debug image)
or a similar command depending on distribution 
The syscall_table.S is usually at /usr/src/linux-source/arch/i386/kernel/syscall_table.S


1. Disassembly for each function is created in the disassembly subfolder via objdump
2. The profiler manager (build using make above) is run on each disassembly file to generate
the actual results in the profiles folder. It invokes the profiler for the actual file and then
for all the relevant dependencies
